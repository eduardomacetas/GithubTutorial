## GITHUB TUTORIAL

In this repository you will learn how to:

    * Create and use a repository
    * Start and manage a new branch
    * Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
    * Open and merge a pull request

Let’s get started with GitHub! :blush:

## What is Github?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like Repositories, Branches, Commits, and Pull Requests. You will create your own  repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/eduardomacetas/GithubTutorial/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/eduardomacetas/GithubTutorial/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
