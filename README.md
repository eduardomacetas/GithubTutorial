## GITHUB TUTORIAL

In this repository you will learn how to:

    * Create and use a repository
    * Start and manage a new branch
    * Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
    * Open and merge a pull request

Let’s get started with GitHub! :blush:

## What is Github?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like Repositories, Branches, Commits, and Pull Requests. You will create your own  repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

## 1. Create a Repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. I recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

### Create a new repository

```
1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar, click and then select **New repository**.
2. Name your repository `First-Repository`.
3. Write a short description. 
4. Choose to make the repository either public or private. 
5. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.

#NOTE: Public repositories are visible to the public, while private repositories are only accessible to you, and people you share them with. Your account must be on a paid plan to create a private repository. 
```

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/eduardomacetas/GithubTutorial/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/eduardomacetas/GithubTutorial/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
